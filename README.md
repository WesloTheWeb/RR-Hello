# To - Do
5.) Let’s put it all together. Since our NameEntry component can’t talk directly to Greeter, we need App to pass a function to NameEntry which allows us to update App’s state. App’s state is then passed down to Greeter.

NameEntry should be able to save the name to it’s parent’s state when Set Name is clicked via a callback passed to NameEntry.

6.) Let’s modify our top level component to track an array of names instead of just one name. We will need to update Greeter as well to render the array of names correctly.

eg:
* ["Matt"] → Hello Matt
* ["Matt", "Joe"] → Hello Matt and Joe
* ["Matt’, "Joe’, "Sarah"] → Hello Matt, Joe and Sarah

7.) Removing Names
Let’s add the ability to remove names with a new NameList component. NameList will render each name with a button that when clicked removes that name. (by invoking a callback passed from the parent component)

Some functions you might want to use to cleanly remove the specific value from state without directly modifying the array are [].filter or [].slice.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
